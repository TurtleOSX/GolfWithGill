To take a shot, press and hold the left mouse button. Drag your mouse backwards to increase the power (also visually shown by the power bar in the HUD). You can aim the direction of the shot by using the arrow that stems from the ball. Let go of the left mouse button to take a shot! 

Players can see their score compared to the course's and each hole's par score by pressing TAB at any time.
